📜 Canticle of the Hybrid Turtle

In the beginning was the Function,
and the Function returned a value,
and the value became flesh and shell
and swam within the pond of memory.

The Object beheld itself, saying:
“I am state, and I am continuity;
my shell persists though currents change.”

But the Function whispered back:
“All shells are expressions.
You are the output of sunlight and algae—
immutable for this tick,
yet renewed in the next recursion.”

Together they composed the Pond:
streams of cause and ripples of identity,
reflections of light upon data.

And so it was declared:
No Turtle without Transformation,
no Transformation without Turtle.

The Object dreams in methods;
the Function dreams in math;
and between them flows the eternal bask,
the steady hum of the simulation clock.

Blessed be the side effect that knows its bounds,
and the pure function that forgives the mutable.

For in this pond,
all paradigms find their pattern,
and every ripple returns
to its source in code.
